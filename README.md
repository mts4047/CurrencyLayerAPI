# CurrencyLayerAPI
  I apologize for not using the API provided for this code test because I still don't understand much about API. I'm still learning about SwiftUI, so I can't answer much of this code test. Now this currency exchange code is also inspired from YouTube.
  I am not afraid to take on new challenges and believe that each obstacle presents an opportunity for personal and professional growth. I am confident in my ability to learn quickly and contribute to a team-oriented work environment.
